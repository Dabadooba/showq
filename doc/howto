Ante-scriptum :
this howto was written in French by Klaus Löhmann for a sound technician who was replacing him for a theater show and didn't know nothing about a linux environment and/or showq.
It's been translated to English by Olivier Humbert to feed back the showq project on the 1st of September 2016.

SHOWQ Howto 09.01.2016

Note: Showq is able to start the jackd audio server when launched.
That said, in most cases, you might want to start the jackd server yourself before launching ShowQ.
You can use the well-known QjackCtl for that purpose.



1. Starting a new show :
File > New 
showq will ask « Clear the current show? », click OK.



2. Adding an audio cue :
Beware that showq only accept .flac or .wav files.
Edit > New Cue > Wave Cue

2.a Info Tab

Description :: what you want to describe it
Wait time :: this is the period of time between the launch (with the space bar) and the real start of playing the audio.
Auto continue :: if the next cue needs to be launched in the same time.

2.b Trigger Tab
To add a keyboard shortcut to your cue, click in the field and press the key(s).

3. Adding a cue Fade :
Edit > New Cue > Fade Cue

3.a Info Tab
Cue :: give a unique number (this number becomes the « target » in fade/stop/pause-cues).
Description :: what you want to describe it
Wait time :: this is the period of time between the launch (with the space bar) and the real start of playing the audio.

Auto continue :: if the next cue needs to be launched in the same time.

3.b Trigger Tab

3.c Fade Tab
Fade Time :: the period of time of the fade.
Default :: means that the file will be played until its end (even if it's not audible anymore).
Stop on fade complete :: stops the wave when the fade is finished.
Pause on fade complete :: pauses the wave (it'll be able to be continued later).

3.d Levels Tab
The faders levels represent the level at which the wave will be played when the fade is finished.
For a fade out, you'll put "-inf", but one can imagine fade in ase well (starting the wave at "-inf" et bring it up with the fade until 0db), or imagine the sound level raising up and/or falling down on each independant outputs.
To be able to change the level, the faders need not to be greyed out (click on the buttons below each fader).



4. Removing a cue from the cue sheet
Select the cue you want to remove :
Edit > Cut 
Showq will ask « Delete sound cue Nr x ? ».



5. Changing the cue sheet order :
Do a drag'n'drop on the cue title to move a cue around. 
The cue needs not to be selected before

IMPORTANT NOTES
###############

1. You must think to save the show after having done some change on it. Showq will not ask you to save it while exiting.
2. If you stop a fade-cue before its end (Escape key, or click on Stop), showq will not be correctly running anymore. (Bug in the dans le sequential). You need then to relaunch it.
3. Do not use the « Renumber » functionnality. It doesn't work and will set all the cues and targets to 0.
4. When the cue sheet is ended, it is adviced to un-tick the « auto cont » option in the Menu > View in order to avoid human-made incidents during the performances.
